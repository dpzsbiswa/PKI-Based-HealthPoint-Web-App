## 🔄 How It Works

### File Encryption Process

1. **Upload**: User selects a file and recipient
2. **Key Retrieval**: System retrieves recipient's public key
3. **Encryption**: File is encrypted using RSA with recipient's public key
4. **Storage**: Encrypted file is stored on server
5. **Download**: Only the recipient can decrypt using their private key

### Appointment Booking Process

1. **Doctor Registration**: Doctor registers with specialization, consultation fee, availability
2. **Patient Booking**: Patient selects doctor, date, and time slot
3. **Payment Processing**: Automatic redirect to eSewa payment gateway
4. **Payment Verification**: HMAC SHA-256 signature verification
5. **Status Update**: Appointment status updated based on payment result

### eSewa Payment Integration

1. **Payment Initiation**: System creates payment form with transaction UUID
2. **Signature Generation**: HMAC SHA-256 signature for payment security
3. **Gateway Redirect**: User redirected to eSewa payment page
4. **Payment Processing**: eSewa processes the payment
5. **Callback Handling**: Payment result verified and appointment updated

### Message Security

1. **Signing**: Each message is signed with sender's private key
2. **Transmission**: Message and signature are sent to recipient
3. **Verification**: Recipient can verify message authenticity using sender's public key
4. **Integrity**: Any tampering with the message will fail verification

### Appointment File Sharing

1. **File Upload**: Doctor selects file, appointment, and categorizes by type
2. **Encryption**: File encrypted with patient's public key using RSA
3. **Storage**: Encrypted file stored with appointment metadata
4. **Access Control**: Only appointment participants can view files
5. **Download**: Patient decrypts file using their private key
6. **Management**: Doctors can delete files, patients can view/download
